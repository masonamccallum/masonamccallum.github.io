## Improve your Laboratory

> Think of the computer as a physicist would his laboratory--you may use it to check your existing ideas about the construction of the world, or as a tool for discovering new phenomena which then demand new ideas for their explanation.

> - Tristan Needham in Visual Complex Analysis

It is my belief that version control will vastly improve the reach and efficiency of your laboratory. This page serves as a companion to a talk I am organizing to introduce version control. If you are new to version control I have compiled here my favorite resources and repositories. While I am not an expert in any of the mentioned tools I do recognize that they have provided tremendous value to my work and hope you find the same.

## Before the Talk
- Make sure you have git running on your laptop. [see instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Brush up on how to use the command line. [Here](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/lym/latest/lym.pdf)
## Attend the Talk
#### Measuring Stick

- [Watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJUJ4wbFm_A) <sup>Start either at beginning or 15 minutes based on audience comfort</sup>.
- If the command line interface is not for you, try GitKraken: [GitKraken Website](https://www.gitkraken.com)
- GitKraken/CLI demo. I will use the CLI in GitKraken. I think this will be a helpful learning tool.

## After Talk
1. Look through the cool GitHub projects mentioned below.
2. Read Chapter 1-3 and 7 of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
