## Improve your Laboratory

> Think of the computer as a physicist would his laboratory--you may use it to check your existing ideas about the construction of the world, or as a tool for discovering new phenomena which then demand new ideas for their explanation.

> - Tristan Needham in Visual Complex Analysis

It is my belief that version control will vastly improve the reach and efficiency of your laboratory. This page serves as a companion to a talk I am organizing to introduce version control. If you are new to version control I have compiled here my favorite resources and repositories. While I am not an expert in any of the mentioned tools I do recognize that they have provided tremendous value to my work and hope you find the same.

## Attend the Talk
- Here the goal is to set up the mental model for new users and introduce new tools for experienced users
- If the command line interface is not for you, try GitKraken: [GitKraken Website](https://www.gitkraken.com)
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- GitKraken/CLI demo. I will use the CLI in GitKraken. I think this will be a helpful learning tool.

## After Talk | Complete 1 and either 2 or 3
1. Look through the cool GitHub projects mentioned below.
2. Watch: [GitHub Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG90LZotrpo).
