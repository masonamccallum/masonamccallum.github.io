About
----
I am currently a PhD student at Southern Methodist University in the Computational and Applied Mathematics Department. My background is in Computer science and Mathematics from Tarleton State university. My work as a Applied Mathematician fulfills my childhood dream of working on the cutting edge of science and engineering. I am inspired by the exciting work I get to engage in and discuss with other passionate mathematicians.

Personal
----
My wife works in the Emergency department at a local hospital. I love all the exciting stories she has and she love the work. We enjoy exploring local resturants, ping pong, board games, and hanging out with our family. When I am not working on my research or hanging out with family I get outdoors. My dream is to backcountry bow hunt elk in the mountains of Montana. I also love trout fishing and cooking over a fire.
